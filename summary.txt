On a quiet Tuesday afternoon, a small blue 
kite drifted over the rooftops of a bustling town, 
tugging gently at its string as if it had a mind of its own.
 People glanced up now and then, wondering where it had come from,
  but no one seemed to be holding the other end. As it floated higher, 
  weaving between clouds, it almost felt like the kite was 
  exploring—surveying markets, skipping over cafés, and drifting 
  above gardens where children played. By evening, when the sky turned orange,
   the little kite was still wandering, becoming a tiny speck against the fading light,
    as if determined to see just how far the wind could take it.
